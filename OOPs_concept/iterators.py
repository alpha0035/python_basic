# is an object that holds a sequence of values and provide sequential traversal through a collection of items such as lists, tuples and dictionaries
# The Python iterators object is initialized using the iter() method. 
# It uses the next() method for iteration.
# __iter__(): __iter__() method initializes and returns the iterator object itself.
# __next__(): the __next__() method retrieves the next available item, throwing a StopIteration exception when no more items are available.

# Creating an iterator
# Creating a custom iterator in Python involves defining a class 
# that implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods according to the Python iterator protocol.
# Define the Class: Start by defining a class that will act as the iterator.
# Initialize Attributes: In the __init__() method of the class, initialize any required attributes that will be used throughout the iteration process.
# Implement __iter__(): This method should return the iterator object itself. This is usually as simple as returning self.
# Implement __next__(): This method should provide the next item in the sequence each time itâ€™s called.
